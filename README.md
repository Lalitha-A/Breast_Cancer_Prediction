# Breast Cancer_Prediction

Model

Trained a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on the features provided in the dataset. The model is trained using the scikit-learn library in Python.
Algorithms Used are:
1.Logistic Regression
2.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3.Naive Bayes

Evaluation Metrics used are:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall

The best model is selected from the above trained models is based on the RECALL value. High recall means fewer false negatives, which is important because missing a malignant case could lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, potentially affecting patient outcomes.
